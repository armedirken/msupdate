## Synopsis

MATHSIMULATION is a Web based CAE software (computational aid engineering software) wich helps you to make physics simulations without the necessity of installation or a powerful computer.

## Motivation

This software is developed as my thesis project in the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos (National University of San Marcos) Lima Peru but I am planning to expand as a my own company.

## Installation

Only create an account in www.mathsimulation.com and start making simulations.
